\section{Introduction}

An authentication bible collects up information on how authentication works,
in one easy to read reference work. While my usual, initial and default habit,
is exhaustive exploration, that never gets to any sort of completion. For this
document, structuring the work in terms of Objective and Key Results (OKRs),
which will provide both a roadmap, and a notion of when it's complete.

\paragraph{Objective} Create an In-depth Primer on Deployed Authentication

% TODO: Clean up the formatting here:
% * no indentation for "Key Result"

Key Results:
