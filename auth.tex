\section{Basic Auth}

From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication}{%
  Basic Access Authentication on Wikipedia}, is a method for an HTTP
user agent to provide a user and password when making a request.

The request contains a header field in the form \texttt{Authorization: Basic
 <credentials>}. Credentials are in the form \texttt{username:password} encoded in
Base64, that is, the \texttt{username} and \texttt{password} are separated by a colon
and Base64 encoded.

Some notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617}{%
      RFC 7617 The 'Basic' HTTP Authentication Scheme} is the
    canonical reference.
  \item MacOs has the \texttt{base64} available for the command line. Utilities
    exist in Ruby, Python, etc. for managing base64 encoding.
  \item \href{https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Basic.html}{%
      Basic Auth is part of Rails}, hence available to every Rails application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic Auth in Rails}

The key is the \texttt{authenticate} metaprogramming
\href{https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/fbe2433be6e052a1acac63c7faf287c52ed3c5ba/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb#L119}{%
  defined in ActiveModel::SecurePassword}.


\subsection{Exercises}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Run the following from the command line: \texttt{%
      echo "username:password" | base64}. What is returned?
    I get \texttt{dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQK}.
  \item Examine the HTTP request headers for a service using Basic Auth
    to see how the header looks.
  \item Find some source code using Basic Auth and understand how
    it's implemented in that code. If you can't find anything, write
    a simple open source example for yourself.
\end{itemize}

\section{OAuth2}


\section{JWT}

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a URL-safe means for representing
claims in JSON format to be transferred between two parties.

Some notes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token}{%
     JSON Web Token on Wikipedia}
  \item \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519}{%
     RFC 7519 JSON Web Token (JWT)}
 \item JWT may used to implement SSO.
\end{itemize}

\section{Glossary}

\paragraph{base64url} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications}{%
  Base64Url} as described in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648}{%
    RFC 4648 The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encoding}

\section{Source code}

\section{TODO}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Write a simple, 1 file Rails application which demos Basic Auth
    using Rails built-in capability.
\end{itemize}
