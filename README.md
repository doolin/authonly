# Authentication notes

This repo has a number of authentication toys demonstrating
how various schemes such as basic auth and jwt work.

The `src` directory is currently Ruby/sh only.

All the rack servers now run in Docker containers
with a compose file to spin them all up at the same
time, very convenient.
